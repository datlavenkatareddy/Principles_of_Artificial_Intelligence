## Lab Title
Experiment 1: Conceptual Representation of an Artificial Intelligence System

---

## Aim
To design and represent an Artificial Intelligence system using a structured diagram, highlighting its key components and workflow.

---

## Objectives
- To understand the basic architecture of AI systems  
- To visualize the flow of data and decision-making in AI  
- To represent AI concepts using diagrams  
- To improve conceptual clarity through graphical representation  

---

## Tools Used
- draw.io (diagrams.net) – for creating AI system diagrams  
- GitHub – for version control and documentation  

---

## Experiment Description
In this experiment, a conceptual diagram was created to illustrate the working of an Artificial Intelligence system.

The diagram demonstrates:
- Input data to the AI system  
- Processing and decision-making logic  
- Output or system response  
- Flow of information within the system  

This representation helps in understanding how AI systems analyze inputs and produce intelligent outputs.

## Diagram Structure
The AI system follows a simple workflow:

Start / Input  
↓  
AI Analysis and Processing  
↓  
Decision Making  
↓  
Output / Action  
↓  
End
