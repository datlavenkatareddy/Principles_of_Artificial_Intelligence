# Principles of Artificial Intelligence – Lab

## Overview
This repository contains lab work for the course **Principles of Artificial Intelligence**.  
The objective of this lab is to understand and visualize AI concepts using diagrams created in **draw.io (diagrams.net)**.

---

## Lab Title
**Experiment: Conceptual Representation of an AI System**

---

## Aim
To design and represent an Artificial Intelligence system using a structured diagram, highlighting its key components and workflow.

---

## Tools Used
- **draw.io (diagrams.net)** – for creating the experiment diagram
- **GitHub** – for version control and documentation

---

## Experiment Description
In this experiment, a conceptual diagram was created to illustrate the working of an AI system.  
The diagram demonstrates:
- Input data
- Processing/decision-making components
- Output or results
- Flow of information within the system

This visual representation helps in better understanding the principles and architecture of AI systems.
